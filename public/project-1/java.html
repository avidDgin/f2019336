        <p>Java was created in 1991 and still highly used in modern day programming. Java runs from a virtual machine making it very portable, meaning it can run from any machine that has Java on it without needing to be recompiled. It is similar C++ but
            lacks the ability to manipulate addresses so it gives a little less control but it has garbage collection so it is much harder to suffer from a memory leak than it is in C++.
